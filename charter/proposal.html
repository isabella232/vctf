    <h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>

   <p>
There is currently no widely used user-centric and privacy-enhancing standard
for expressing and transacting verifiable claims (aka: credentials,
attestations) via the Web.
   </p>
   <p>
These problems exist today:
   </p>
   <ul>
       <li>
There is no standard that makes it easy for users to assert their verifiable
qualifications to a service provider (e.g. my loyalty card number is X, I
have an account at Bank Y, I am over the age of 21, I am a citizen of the USA,
I am a Chartered Financial Analyst, etc.).
       </li>
       <li>
In existing attribute exchange architectures (like SAML, OpenID Connect, Login
with SuperProviderX, etc.), users do not independently exist from service
providers. This means users can't easily change their service provider without
losing their digital identity. This leads to vendor lock-in, identity
fragility, reduced competition in the marketplace, and reduced privacy for
all stakeholders.
       </li>
       <li>
There is no interoperable standard capable of expressing and transmitting
rich verifiable claims that cuts across industries (e.g., finance, retail,
education, and healthcare). This leads to industry-specific solutions that
are costly, inefficient, proprietary, and inhibit users' ability to manage
their digital identities in a cohesive way.
       </li>
   </ul>

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

   <p>
Research into this problem was performed by the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a>
via the
<a href="http://w3c.github.io/vctf/">Verifiable Claims Task Force</a>.
The research findings can be found in the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dYup3KC2nak3LVTzyapr996TKxDj1w5Eyp4g13rQQBA/edit">Verifiable Claims Task Force Final Report</a>.
The findings suggest that there is consensus to address a
@@@narrow set of use cases@@@ around the data model and syntax(es) for
expressing verifiable claims as well as an analysis of how the data model
and syntax(es) could be combined with existing technology to address the
problems listed above.
   </p>

   <p>
For more background information about this group, please see @@@the FAQ@@@.
   </p>

    <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

	<p>The Working Group will Recommend:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
a data model and syntax(es) for the expression of rich verifiable claims
    </li>
    <li>
a note specifying how these data models should be used with existing
attribute exchange protocols, a recommendation that existing protocols
should be modified, or a recommendation that a new protocol is required to
address the problems stated earlier in this document.
    </li>
  </ol>

	<p>The Working Group will not:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Define a new protocol for attribute exchange.</li>
  </ol>

	<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

	<dl>
	  <dt id="claim"><strong>verifiable claim</strong></dt>
      <dd>A machine-readable statement made by an entity that is cryptographically authentic (non-repudiable).</dd>
	  <dt id="credential"><strong>credential (aka attestation)</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A set of verifiable claims that refer to a qualification, achievement, personal quality, aspect of an identity such as a name, government ID, preferred payment processor, home address, or university degree typically used to indicate suitability.</dd>
	</dl>

        <h3 id="security">Security and Privacy Considerations</h3>

	<p>Security is obviously critical for verifiable claims.</p>

	<p>The Working Group will work with the organizations
 listed in the liaisons section of the charter to help ensure data model and
 document security.</p>

       <p>Protection of the privacy of all participants in a credentials
 ecosystem
 is essential to maintaining the trust that credential systems are
 dependent upon to function. A credential format defined by this group
 should not disclose private details of the participants' identity or
 other sensitive information unless
 required for operational purposes, by legal or jurisdictional rules, or when
 deliberately consented to (e.g. as part of a loyalty program) by the
 owner of the information. The design of any data model and format should
 guard against the unwanted leakage of such data through exploitation
 of the API.</p>

      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

        <h3 id="vc-data-model">Verifiable Claims Data Model and Syntax Recommendation</h3>

        <p>This Recommendation will define or identify a:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Model</strong>: for expressing rich verifiable claims in a semantically extensible way.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Syntax(es)</strong>: that are machine-readable and capable of expressing the data model across a variety of formats.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Signature Mechanism(s)</strong>: that are capable of protecting the verifiable claims from attack such that the claims can be trusted by consumers of those claims.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="vc-implementation-guidance">Verifiable Claims Implementation Guidance</h3>

        <p>This NOTE will define or identify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
How the data model and syntax can be used with existing attribute exchange architectures to address all of the problems stated in this document, or
            </li>
            <li>
How the data model and syntax can be used with a set of modifications to existing attribute exchange architectures, or
            </li>
            <li>
If a new attribute exchange protocol is needed and if so, requirements for that protocol to address the problems identified in this document.
            </li>
        </ul>


	<h3 id="process-planning">Process and Planning</h3>

        <h4 id="community-specs">Preference for Community Developed Specifications</h4>

	<p>The Working Group will actively seek to base its
deliverables on specifications that have been socialized
in <a href="/community/">W3C Community Groups</a> or contributed
as <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/">W3C Member
	    Submissions</a>.</p>

	<h4 id="interop-criteria">Interoperability Success Criteria</h4>

	<p>The Working Group will fulfill the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#implementation-experience">implementation experience required by the W3C Process</a> as follows:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The Working Group will develop test suites for Recommendation-track specifications.</li>
	  <li>The group will seek independent interoperable implementations by two software libraries.</a>.</li>
	  <li>For any implementation cited to establish interoperability success, the Working Group will work with the WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group (or its successor) to help communicate accessibility issues to the developers.</li>

        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this
            group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When a Chair puts a question and observes
            dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should put a question out for voting
            within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or
            web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
            considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.</p>

        <p>Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference (i.e., that does not follow a 7 day
            call for consensus on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional until 5 working days after the
            publication of the draft resolution. If no
            objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>
